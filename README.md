Implementation of the RankSVM multilabel classifier (<a href="http://cse.seu.edu.cn/people/zhangml/files/NIPS02.pdf">Elisseeff and Weston, 2001</a>) as an add-on for Mulan.

Mulan is a multilabel learning library written in java. You can find it <a href="http://mulan.sourceforge.net/">here</a>.


Test project, the optimization part is broken (java libraries can't handle large matrices)
